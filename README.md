# pokemon-app

I have created a Pokemon listing page where we can see the list of pokemons on load.

Also added a search feature that checks within name and abilities and returns the matched pokemons.

Along with that also included the sort functionality with name, weight and height.

Have used SCSS for styling purposes.
