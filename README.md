# pokemon-app

I have created a Pokemon listing page where we can see the list of pokemons on load which is being fetched from the below API.
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon?limit=20&offset=0

Functionalities included: 
 - search feature that checks within name and abilities of each pokemon and returns the matched pokemons.
 - sort functionality with name, weight and height values.
 - pagination to change the no. of cards per page.
 - keyboard accessible functionalities

I have used SCSS for styling purposes in this application.
